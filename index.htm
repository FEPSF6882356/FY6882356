 <section id="Abstract">
 
 <p class="ex1">
	 
     <pre>When deciding to be live an active lifestyle there 2 means of training; High intensity and Low intensity,
	  each have their own benefits and drawbacks. However, what should be considered is level
	  of commitment and implementation in tailoring your workouts to reach your specific fitness goals.
	  Whether that be Maximising muscle size, improving endurance or peaking your genetic athletic performance.
	  In this short article I will go through the scientific ways in which you can achieve muscle maturity effectively.
  </pre></p>
   
    </section>

	 <section id="Low Intensity Training">
 
 <p class="ex1">
	 
     <pre>Low intensity endurance training leads to the development of local skeletal muscles,
	  for example increased mitochondrial biogenesis / capillary density. This therefore allows for a greater transport of oxygen to regenerate ATP,
	  releasing energy, preventing the build-up of lactic acids and causing muscle fatigue in aerobic performance. [ Joyner, M.J. and Coyle, E.F. (2008)].
	  On a test of sedentary obese males they with a BMI of over 30, they deduced that low intensity training (e.g long distance running, swimming etc) over 
	  a longer duration of time closer to the FAT max (the maximum amount of fat burned within an hour) performed the best in reducing their weights and thus
	  increasing the cardiovascular outputs; which in turn improved there endurance.[ Khanfir, M.A. et al. (2022)].However the only negative with this method would 
	  be the time commitment as the aforementioned study required 3 to 4 days or training ranging from an hour onwards until maximum cardiovascular threshold was reached.
  </pre></p>
   
    </section>
	
<section id="High Intensity training">	
	<p class="ex1">

     <pre>High intensity training can be summarised with 2 categories HIIT (high intensity interval training) and Heavy weights low repetitions’ is a highly time effective and
	  efficient method of stimulating substantial muscle growth, as it involves one or a set of movements at maximum effort over a short period of time. The practical implication
	  of the program allows for overweight individuals to quickly lose weight. [Boutcher, S.H. (2010)]. While Heavy weights on the other hand tend to have different
	  affects depending on your initial muscle maturity, for example a well built physique is unlikely to see significant skeletal muscle hypertrophy form training as compared
	  to a un built physique, this is due to the natural muscle capacity limitations due to muscle insertions, frame and hormone responses such as that of myostatin. Although
	  this does not necessarily transfer over to strength gains, as the more a movement is preformed the more mind muscle connections can be formed as neural pathways interlinking
	  the brain to the muscle become stronger leading to more muscle recruitment the more a muscle is used, as well as more efficient muscle connectivity chains being created allowing 
	  for greater strength to be achieved with prolonged exposure. to stimuli. [Lopez, P. et al. (2021)] As a direct result of this athletic performance can increase yearly 
	  without the necessary gain of additional muscle, the best method in modern use would result from greater time under tension whilst performing eccentric movements such as lowering
	  weights form a bicep curl. This method of training allows for more easy time management, and less overall effort as compared to the HIIT and low intensity training
	  as maximum effort is only used for a shorter duration in comparison to the overall length of the workout. [ Using eccentric training to increase muscle mass (2020)]
  </pre></p>
   
    </section>
	
<section id="Using PEDS to enhance Performance">	
	<p class="ex1">

     <pre>Many athletes tend to use PEDS (performance enhancing drugs) to increase their muscle output as well as increase training efficiencies have been shown to bring an overall
	  increase in strength, endurance and hypertrophy when paired with either low intensity or High intensity training. For example, the use of HGH (human growth hormone)
	  to be used by athletes to increase collagen synthesis in their tendons in order to increase their size allowing for their bodies to hold more skeletal muscle which in turn
	  allows for a greater performance in sports and other activities. [ Doessing, S. et al. (2010)]. In total there an insurmountable number of steroids and other supplements
	  made but the general gist is that they suppress a certain hormone in order to increase another. This then allows the body to obtain inhuman levels of strength for example if the hormone
	  myostatin in reduced by using glucocorticoids. A notable fact during this experiment was that participants gained tendon strength enough though they did not train , the steroid (HGH) 
	  increase there base line muscle allowing them to be stronger without the added effort of training.
  </pre></p>
   
    </section>

	<section id="Conclusion">	
	<p class="ex1">

     <pre>In conclusion it can clearly been seen that any form of training is greater for muscle hypertrophy than a sedentary lifestyle, it also shows that just taking PEDs
	  without training is still a decent form of gaining strength as both tendons and ligaments growth as due to the abnormal number of hormones in the body. However this does
	  not come without side effects, mainly in the form of liver damage as long prolong cycles of HGH or other steroids have been known to cause the heart to enlarge , leading to increased
	  blood pressure and damaged arteries, impotence, osteoporosis, women’s menstrual irregularities, and cardiomyopathy. The best practice is to micro dose beneath the 
	  recommended level for your BMI, this largely then mitigates the adverse side affects as well as giving you a substantial amount of benefits as can be seen with testosterone
	  replacement therapy for adults whom either injure the testis or have dysfunctional ones. Allowing there body to behave in the natural manner once more.[ Saugy, M. et al. (2006)]

             <p>This articles simply summarises the fundamental differences between High intensity Training vs low intensity training with its respect to Cardiovascular health, fat loss, muscle endurance and recovery. Additionally, I will discuss the controversial use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) in fitness, taking into account there impacts on one’s performance, recovery and longer-term health risks associated with taking these. </p>

            <h2>High Itensity Taining:</h2>
                
                <p>HIT method requires short quick bursts of intense training done at 70-90% of one’s maximum effort capabilities, a good example of such can be high intensity interval training (HIIT) which includes; sprinting, CrossFit, plyometrics and circuit training. One of the greatest advantages of HIT is that it is incredibly time efficient, requiring only 20-30 minutes per day and offering substantial health benefits in terms of calorie expenditure, “enhancing cardiovascular function” , “Increasing VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake)”and “Enhanced metabolic efficiency of muscle tissue”.

 Little, J.P. et al. (2010,p. 2-7) </p>


<p>
Among the Important keys to high intensity training is the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption or EPOC. Which referrers to the body continuing to “impact fuel utilization for up to 24 hours post-exercise” as oxygen levels and muscle tissue is regulated while metabolic waste is removed. This makes the training highly ideal for individuals whom wish to maximise fat loss in the shortest period of time.

[Collins, A., 2020. The Afterburn Effect:]</p>


<p>
High intensity training also increases the VO2 max of a person which enables them to preform better in activities that require quick releases of energy, such as weightlifting and or competitive sports. Proof of this can be seen on the graph below of 61 participants which shows that high intensity interval training (HIIT) leads to greater improvements in VO2 max compared to moderate-intensity continuous training.

[2024. Effect of Intensity of Aerobic Training on V˙O2max]</p>


<p>
Aside from the benefits mentioned so far, there is a sizable , the intensity of the workouts however raise the likely hood of injury especially among beginners or people with previous conditions. Common injury’s include muscle strains, joint problems and cardiovascular stress. So the proper warm ups and cool downs / adequate recovery are essential to avoid overtraining, else a sharp decline in performance and increased risk of injury occur. However when done correctly there can be “rapid muscle growth and strength increases” with in the first year of training as well as “Quick improvements in neuromuscular coordination” , this is commonly known as newbie gains.[ A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Resistance Training] </p>
